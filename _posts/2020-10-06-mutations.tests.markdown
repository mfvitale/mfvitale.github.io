How many of you haerd at least one time in their career this sentence: "**We must have a code coverage >= 80% for release to production**"?

<p align="center">

</p>

I totally agree with this sentence

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Code coverage is a side effect, not a goal. The only time I find the metric useful is when I’m working with legacy and want to have an indication if there are tests for the part of the code I’m interested in.</p>&mdash; Sandro Mancuso (@sandromancuso) <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso/status/1091701221390516224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2019</a></blockquote>

I think that sometime (lot of times) this "number" is used only as a goal but it should be a "tool" for developers to understand the fragility of the code that they are going to change. 

* High coverage :relaxed:
* Low coverage :fearful:
