Hello! I'm Mario, a software engineer with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 }} years of experience.

I have worked for consultancy, startup, and enterprise product companies in different sectors. 
I am mainly a back-end developer but I had some experience working on the frot-end. 

I am a very curious person and I like to keep growing my skills. I care about code quality and readability.

I believe in tests as a tool to increase quality and reduce fear to evolve code.

I care about developers day by day life and I believe that automation comes in handy to reduce repetitive tasks and focus on what is important: features.
